**How to set the price of my property on Moïen?**

Setting a fair and competitive price for renting your property is essential to attract tenants while maximizing your income. Here are some steps and tips to determine the price of your property on Moïen:

**1. Market analysis**

- **Check similar prices**: Before setting your price, examine similar properties in your area. Compare characteristics such as size, location, number of rooms, amenities, and rental duration.
- **Research tools**: Moïen allows you to check approximate prices for similar properties to guide your decision.

**2. Type of rental and duration**

- **Short-term rental**: Prices can be higher due to flexibility and short stay duration. Remember to adjust your price according to seasonality (e.g., holiday periods or local events may justify a higher rate).
- **Long-term rental**: Monthly prices are often lower but guarantee a stable source of income. You can offer discounts for long-term commitments.
- **Subletting**: If you are a tenant and wish to sublet, you must also consider market prices while respecting the limits imposed by your landlord.

**3. Additional costs to consider**

- **Cleaning fees**: If you offer a cleaning service at the end of each stay, you can add this cost to the rental price.

- **Dynamic pricing**: If you can adjust your prices based on demand (e.g., increasing prices during high-demand periods), this can optimize your income.

**5. Monitoring and adjustment**

- **Performance monitoring**: If you notice that your property remains unoccupied for a long period, it may mean that your price is too high compared to demand. Do not hesitate to adjust your price based on feedback and market trends.
- **Comments and evaluation**: Tenants who appreciate the quality of your property and the rental experience can leave positive reviews that will help you justify a slightly higher price.

💡 **Setting a competitive price on Moïen requires a good market analysis and understanding of your tenants' specific needs. Offering a good experience and adjusting your prices based on demand is essential for success in rental.**
