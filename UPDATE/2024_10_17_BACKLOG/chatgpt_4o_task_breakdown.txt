### **Grand Total:**
- **Minimum Estimate**: 58 man-months.
- **Maximum Estimate**: 74 man-months.

### **Considerations:**
- This estimate assumes a team of specialists (e.g., frontend and backend developers, mobile developers, designers, and QA engineers).
- Team productivity might vary, and external integrations (like criminality and real estate APIs) can introduce additional complexity, especially if dealing with legal compliance.
- An agile development methodology would likely result in some overlap between different phases, allowing for faster initial releases of core features, while custom features can be added in subsequent releases.

Thus, a mid-sized team of around **10-12 developers and designers** could complete this project in about **6-7 months** with parallel work streams.

> The team will be made up mainly of junior developers. Could you revise your estimates on the basis of this information?

---

If the development team is primarily made up of **junior developers**, the timeline and required effort would increase due to several factors, including:

- **Slower Development Pace**: Junior developers typically take longer to implement features, as they may require more time to understand complex concepts, follow best practices, and debug issues.
- **Need for Mentorship and Supervision**: Junior developers will likely need more guidance and mentorship from senior developers or team leads. This supervision will consume additional man-hours from the few senior developers available.
- **Higher Likelihood of Errors**: Junior developers tend to make more mistakes, leading to additional time spent on code review, debugging, and refactoring.
- **More Time for Testing and Quality Assurance**: The QA process might take longer due to a potentially higher number of bugs and issues introduced during development.

To adjust the estimate for a team primarily made up of junior developers, we can apply a scaling factor based on these factors. A common multiplier for junior teams is anywhere from **1.5x to 2x** the effort of a team composed of senior and mid-level developers.

### **Revised Total Estimate for Junior Team:**
- **Minimum Estimate**: ~89 man-months.
- **Maximum Estimate**: ~142 man-months.

### **Considerations for Junior Developer Teams**
- **Mentorship and Senior Developers**: It’s highly recommended to have at least 1-2 senior developers or technical leads to oversee the junior team, particularly for key architectural decisions, complex systems (like payments, real-time booking), and code reviews. Even with mostly junior developers, having senior guidance can improve efficiency and reduce errors.

- **Modular Development**: To manage the complexity of the project, work can be divided into smaller, manageable modules or microservices. This approach allows junior developers to focus on smaller features while senior developers manage the more complex tasks.

- **Code Reviews & Pair Programming**: Encouraging practices like regular code reviews and pair programming can help junior developers improve faster and ensure a higher quality codebase, though this also adds some overhead.

- **Quality Assurance & Testing**: Since junior developers are more likely to introduce bugs, investing in robust QA processes and automated testing is crucial to ensure the final product is stable.

### **Timeframe with Junior Team (10-12 members)**:
Considering the increased effort and slower development pace, a team of **10-12 mostly junior developers** would likely take **9-12 months** to complete the project, depending on their experience level, guidance from senior developers, and overall coordination.

If the team lacks sufficient senior mentorship, the timeline could stretch further, and quality issues may arise, requiring even more rework and testing.

### **Grand Total for Junior Developers:**
- **Minimum Estimate**: ~89 man-months.
- **Maximum Estimate**: ~142 man-months.

Given this breakdown, a team of **mostly junior developers** would need **9-12 months** if working with a **10-12 person team**, assuming good mentorship and oversight from senior developers to guide them through the more complex parts of the system. The team would also need to work in an agile fashion to allow for testing, iterations, and bug fixing throughout the project.
