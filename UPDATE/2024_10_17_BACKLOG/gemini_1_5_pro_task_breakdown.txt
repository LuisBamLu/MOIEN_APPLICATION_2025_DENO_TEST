> Could I have an estimate of how many man-months it would take to implement a clone of AirBNB.com website and mobile application, which also allows to manage long term rentals, subletting by long-term tenants, and provides location-based information on criminality, real estate sale prices etc in a given location ?

---

Estimating the time and resources required to build a comprehensive Airbnb clone that includes additional features such as long-term rentals, subletting, and location-based information on criminality and real estate sale prices involves several factors. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown to help you understand the scope and estimated time frame:

## Core Features of Airbnb Clone
- User registration and login
- Property listing and management
- Search and filtering
- Booking and reservation management
- Payment processing
- Rating and reviews
- Host and guest dashboards
- Advanced analytics and admin dashboard.

## Additional Features
- **Long-term rentals and subletting**: This involves complex contractual agreements, recurring payments, and possibly different pricing models. This could add an additional 2-4 months of development time.
- **Location-based information on criminality**: Integrating crime data APIs and displaying this information on the map or property listings. This might require 1-2 months of development.
- **Real estate sale prices**: Integrating real estate data APIs and displaying this information. This could take another 1-2 months.
- **Mobile Application**: Developing a mobile app in addition to the website will roughly double the development time compared to building just a website.

## Development Team and Time Estimate
A typical development team for such a project would include:
- **Backend Developers**: 2-3 developers
- **Frontend Developers**: 2-3 developers
- **Mobile App Developers**: 2-3 developers (if developing for both iOS and Android)
- **Designer**: 1 designer
- **DevOps Engineer**: 1 engineer
- **QA Engineers**: 2-3 engineers

### Time Estimate
- **Core Airbnb Clone Features**:
  - Website: 6-9 months
  - Mobile App: Additional 6-9 months (since it involves separate development for iOS and Android).

- **Additional Features**:
  - Long-term rentals and subletting: 2-4 months
  - Location-based crime data: 1-2 months
  - Real estate sale prices: 1-2 months

### Total Estimated Time
- **Website Only**: 9-14 months (6-9 months for core features + 3-5 months for additional features)
- **Website and Mobile App**: 18-28 months (6-9 months for core website features + 6-9 months for core mobile app features + 6-10 months for additional features across both platforms).

### Man-Months Estimate
Assuming an average team size of 10 developers/designers/engineers:
- **Website Only**: 9-14 months * 10 team members = 90-140 man-months
- **Website and Mobile App**: 18-28 months * 10 team members = 180-280 man-months

## Cost Estimate
The cost can vary widely based on the location and hourly rate of the developers. Here are some rough estimates:
- **Developers in the United States**: $35-$150 per hour. For a project requiring 180-280 man-months, this translates to $3.15 million to $12.6 million.
- **Developers in India**: $10-$65 per hour. For the same project, this would be approximately $630,000 to $3.9 million.

## Conclusion
Building a comprehensive Airbnb clone with the specified additional features is a complex task that requires significant resources and time. The estimated time frame is between 9-28 months, depending on whether you are building just a website or both a website and mobile applications. The man-months estimate ranges from 90-280, and the cost can vary from a few hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars, depending on the location and expertise of the development team.

> The team will be made up mainly of junior developers. Could you revise your estimates on the basis of this information?

---

Given that the team will mostly consist of junior developers, it's important to factor in the learning curve, potential for mistakes, and the need for more extensive code reviews and guidance. Junior developers typically require more time to complete tasks compared to their senior counterparts. Here's a revised estimate considering the team's experience level:

## Revised Time Estimate

### Core Features of Airbnb Clone
- **User registration and login**: 2-3 months
- **Property listing and management**: 3-4 months
- **Search and filtering**: 2-3 months
- **Booking and reservation management**: 3-4 months
- **Payment processing**: 2-3 months
- **Rating and reviews**: 1-2 months
- **Host and guest dashboards**: 2-3 months
- **Advanced analytics and admin dashboard**: 2-3 months

### Additional Features
- **Long-term rentals and subletting**: 4-6 months
- **Location-based information on criminality**: 2-3 months
- **Real estate sale prices**: 2-3 months

### Mobile Application
- **iOS and Android Development**: Additional 12-18 months (since it involves separate development for both platforms and junior developers will need more time for learning and implementation)

## Revised Development Team and Time Estimate
- **Backend Developers**: 3-4 junior developers
- **Frontend Developers**: 3-4 junior developers
- **Mobile App Developers**: 4-5 junior developers (if developing for both iOS and Android)
- **Designer**: 1-2 designers
- **DevOps Engineer**: 1 junior engineer
- **QA Engineers**: 3-4 engineers

### Total Estimated Time
- **Website Only**: 15-22 months (core features + additional features)
- **Website and Mobile App**: 27-36 months (core website features + core mobile app features + additional features across both platforms)

### Man-Months Estimate
Assuming an average team size of 15-20 developers/designers/engineers:
- **Website Only**: 15-22 months * 15-20 team members = 225-440 man-months
- **Website and Mobile App**: 27-36 months * 15-20 team members = 405-720 man-months

## Revised Cost Estimate
The cost can vary widely based on the location and hourly rate of the developers. Here are some rough estimates:
- **Developers in the United States**: $35-$150 per hour. For a project requiring 405-720 man-months, this translates to $5.06 million to $21 million.
- **Developers in India**: $10-$65 per hour. For the same project, this would be approximately $1.62 million to $8.88 million.

## Conclusion
Building a comprehensive Airbnb clone with the specified additional features using a team of mostly junior developers will significantly increase the time and resources required. The estimated time frame is between 15-36 months, depending on whether you are building just a website or both a website and mobile applications. The man-months estimate ranges from 225-720, and the cost can vary from a few million dollars to several million dollars, depending on the location and expertise of the development team.
