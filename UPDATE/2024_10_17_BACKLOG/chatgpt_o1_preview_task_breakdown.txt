> The team will be made up mainly of junior developers. Could you revise your estimates on the basis of this information?

---

Certainly! Adjusting the project estimates to account for a team composed mainly of junior developers is crucial, as it can significantly impact both the timeline and resource allocation. Junior developers typically require more time to complete tasks, need additional supervision, and may produce work that requires more revisions.

---

### **Key Considerations for a Junior Team:**

1. **Productivity Levels:**
   - Junior developers often work at a slower pace due to less experience.
   - They may take longer to understand complex requirements or new technologies.

2. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Code produced may have more bugs or may not follow best practices.
   - Increased need for code reviews and testing to maintain quality standards.

3. **Mentorship and Supervision:**
   - Senior developers or team leads will need to allocate time to mentor junior staff.
   - This supervision time reduces the overall productive hours of senior team members.

4. **Learning Curve:**
   - Time must be allocated for training and ramp-up on tools, frameworks, and the project's domain.

5. **Communication Overheads:**
   - More time spent in meetings and explanations to ensure everyone is on the same page.

---

### **Revised Estimates:**

Given these factors, it's reasonable to **increase the original estimates by approximately 50-70%** for development and testing tasks. Project management and planning may also require adjustments due to the increased coordination efforts.

Below is the adjusted breakdown:

---
